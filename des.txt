This website “a lord that loves” is a website inspired by my Love Actually class where we discussed the 4 principles that make an intimate/long lasting relationship with those for principles being emotional closeness, trust, care, & commitment! My goal is to make a website that talks about how you could apply these principles to a divine relationship like a relationship with God applying similar principles of intimate relationships that can be applied to humans.

There will be a page for each aspect of what makes up an intimate relationship, a home page giving credit to the creator of this theory & a page with all the scriptures I used to talk about how emotional relationships can be applied to having a relationship with God.

On each page on the part where is says “Scriptures Used” there will be a toggle arrow to show/hide the full scripture text.
